# Autoresearch Lab

Use this skill when the user wants to start, resume, or operationalize the autonomous research loop in this repository.

## Use When

- The user wants to kick off or resume `train.py` experiments in this repo
- The user wants help managing `results.tsv`, `run.log`, or experiment branches
- The user wants the repo's original `program.md` workflow turned into a reusable Codex surface

## Do Not Use When

- The task is unrelated to the training experiment loop
- The user wants broad refactors outside the experiment surface
- The work requires changing dependencies or modifying `prepare.py`

## Repo Contract

- Treat `train.py` as the primary experiment surface
- Do not modify `prepare.py`
- Do not add new dependencies
- Preserve the fixed-time-budget benchmark semantics
- Keep git history usable for keep/discard decisions

## Workflow

1. Read `README.md`, `train.py`, and `prepare.py` for repo context.
2. Run the helper to verify prerequisites:

```bash
python .codex/skills/autoresearch-lab/scripts/autoresearch_ops.py check-setup --json
python .codex/skills/autoresearch-lab/scripts/autoresearch_ops.py check-setup --json --repo-only
```

Use `--repo-only` to verify required repo files and tooling without requiring downloaded data shards or a trained tokenizer.

3. If the user is starting a fresh run, create a dedicated branch:

```bash
python .codex/skills/autoresearch-lab/scripts/autoresearch_ops.py create-run-branch --tag apr10
```

4. Ensure the results file exists:

```bash
python .codex/skills/autoresearch-lab/scripts/autoresearch_ops.py ensure-results
```

5. For each experiment iteration:
- Edit `train.py`
- Commit intentionally
- Launch a bounded run:

```bash
python .codex/skills/autoresearch-lab/scripts/autoresearch_ops.py run --log run.log --timeout 600
```

- Parse the summary:

```bash
python .codex/skills/autoresearch-lab/scripts/autoresearch_ops.py parse-log run.log --json
```

- Append the result row:

```bash
python .codex/skills/autoresearch-lab/scripts/autoresearch_ops.py append-result \
  --commit abc1234 \
  --status keep \
  --description "baseline" \
  --log run.log
```

6. Keep or revert the experiment based on the metric and simplicity tradeoff.

## Local Dashboard

For a thin app-style launcher instead of a shell-only workflow, start:

```bash
./autoresearch-dashboard
```

The dashboard exposes:

- an `Autoresearch MacOS` profile for this repository
- a `ToMX Local Quality` profile that reuses the external ToMX workspace and agent TOMLs
- a local chat-style transcript with prompt history and automatic run-summary messages
- profile-aware prompt composition plus a `Send To Codex` action that starts a managed `codex exec` job in the selected workspace
- lightweight run/status controls kept separate from prompt delivery

The dashboard does not automate a GUI app. It resolves the Codex CLI using:

1. `AUTORESEARCH_CODEX_CLI`
2. `CODEX_CLI_PATH`
3. `codex` on `PATH`
4. `/Applications/ChatGPT.app/Contents/Resources/codex`

To configure the external ToMX profile, set `AUTORESEARCH_TOMX_ROOT`,
`AUTORESEARCH_TOMX_PYTHON`, `AUTORESEARCH_TOMX_TASK_PATH`, and
`AUTORESEARCH_TOMX_SKILL_PATH` as needed. Defaults preserve the current local
layout.

## References

- Read `references/protocol.md` for the detailed experiment policy, logging schema, and crash/timeout handling guidance.
- The dashboard imports ToMX agent definitions from the configured ToMX root's `.codex/agents/` directory instead of duplicating them locally.
- `program.md` is still the legacy prompt surface, but prefer this skill plus the helper script for deterministic steps.
